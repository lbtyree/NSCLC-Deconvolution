# NSCLC-Deconvolution

CIBERSORTx code is liscences and you must go to the website and request to use the code, so I am only putting the output to the CIBERORTx algorithm here. The code for Lasso Regression Baseline Model as well as the Tree Regression model can also be found here. I also included snipits from the data for reference where necessary.
