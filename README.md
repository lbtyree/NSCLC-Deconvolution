# NSCLC-Deconvolution

CIBERSORTx code is liscences and you must go to the website and request to use the code, so I am only putting the output to the CIBERORTx algorithm here as to not illegally redistribute. The code for Lasso Regression Baseline Model as well as the Tree Regression model can also be found here. I also included snipits from the data for reference where necessary. The Deconvolution_data file contains the output for the CIBERSORTx algorithm with 10 different mixtures.
